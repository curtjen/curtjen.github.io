## Some of my code

In all truthfulness, this section is mostly here for me so I can quickly get to some of my tools and scripts I find useful. Feel free to use or explore them.

### Testing Tools

#### Test JS

This is a basic test library for making simple assertions in Javascript. It is a quick way to get some sort of testing chasis set up on things like Codepen, Repl.it, and JS Fiddle, without going through the extra steps to get Jest working.

##### Usage

```js
import test from 'https://curtjen.github.io/tools/lib/test.js';

test({ exp: 2, res: 2, msg: 'should match number' });
/* output
# should match number
PASS
*/
test({ exp: 'Bob', res: 'Steve', msg: 'should match name' });
/* output:
# should match name
|__ FAIL
*/
```
